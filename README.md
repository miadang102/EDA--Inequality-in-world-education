# EDA--Inequality-in-world-education
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial in data analytics. This initial exploration guides subsequent data preprocessing and modeling decisions, ensuring a more informed and effective analytical process. EDA plays a pivotal role in enhancing data quality, reducing the risk of biased conclusions, and fostering a deeper comprehension of the dataset's nuances.

In this personal project, I am conducting a EDA using Python to evaluate data quality and uncover initial insights and potential recommendation from an 'Inequality in Education from 2010-2021' database extracted from Human Development Report.
